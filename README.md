New album discovery tool via Spotify APIs

New Albums allows Spotify users to quickly see the latest album from artists they follow. Users are prompted to log in to Spotify and authorize the app to read which artists the user is following. From there, the app loads each artist's albums, finds the most recent, and creates a table of artists sorted by the most recent album released. The resulting table is sorted by most recent release, with direct Spotify links to each album.
